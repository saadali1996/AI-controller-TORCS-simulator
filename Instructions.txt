snakeoil.py and clien.py are credited to x_ched ,used for collecting the training data for our Intelligent Bot.

Scr client trained is the controller implemented with our algorithms to play on the simulator.

AiProject.ipynb contains the code for data preprocessing and cleaning.
->Total data rows 136000 collected from almost all tracks.
->79 features in X.csv(input features)
->7 output values in Y.csv 
->it also contains the code for training random forest multi output random forrest classifier with no of estimators on each node=5 and randomness set to 1.
->test.ipynb contains code for speed optimization of the predict function.
->AI project .ipynb also contains code for training a 3layer fully ocnnected nueral network with 79 i nout dimension and 7 output dimension,non linearity used is RELU,to avoid vanishing gradient.
->Random forrest regressor provides accuracy of 97 persent, whereas the nueral network provides accuracy of 92 percent.
->But the forward pass ie the predict call is faster in the nueral network.
->Can switch between the nueral netwrok and the random forrest,but random forrest overall chossen for test environment.
->Mimimum purity of nodes is set to 85 percent.

Weight Files
->MultiOutputRegressor4.pkl is the saved random forrest model as a pickle file.
->AI.h5 contains the network architecture and weigjhts for the nueral network.
