Nueral network based client is used for steering and accelration values prediction. A keras model was built using dense sequential layers , accuracy achieved from the multi output random forrest regressor but computational constraints for real time inference made us use the nueral network. There is a 10 seconds server timeout so values have to be generated in taht time frame.
